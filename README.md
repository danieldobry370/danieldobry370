I am a graduate of the Master's programme in Interactive Media Theory at Masaryk University in Brno, where I focused on the intersections of digital design, development, and user experience.
<br><br>
My professional focus lies in web and app development, including full-cycle project management - from initial concept and UX/UI design to deployment and long-term scalability. I combine a background in creative technologies with hands-on experience in agile workflows and cross-functional collaboration.
<br><br>
I am also the founder and lead developer of the project Mistr Roku, where I apply these skills in practice.
